# voice-classification-using-ML-PROJECT
Dependencies Used:Librosa Numpy Soundfile Scikit-learn PyAudio.
DatasetCreation:We download and convert the dataset to be suited for extraction.
Loading the dataset:It is about loading the dataset in Python which involves extracting audio features the file should be in .wav type.
After we load the dataset,we use to train it on suited sklearn model. After training we measure how good the model is doing also known as testing.
